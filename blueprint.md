# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture, features, and design of the Flutter application. It serves as a single source of truth for the project, providing a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders.

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern, with a clear separation of concerns between the data, domain, and presentation layers. This ensures that the codebase is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for all communication with external data sources, such as APIs and databases. It includes repositories that abstract the data sources from the rest of the application, as well as models that represent the data.

### Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the business logic of the application. It includes use cases that orchestrate the flow of data between the data and presentation layers, as well as entities that represent the core business objects.

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface. It includes widgets that display the data and handle user input, as well as providers that manage the state of the UI.

## Features

### Authentication

The application includes a complete authentication feature, with support for email and password login and registration. The authentication flow is handled by a dedicated `AuthWrapper` widget, which ensures that the user is always in a valid authentication state.

- **Login Screen**: A visually appealing screen that allows users to log in with their email and password.
- **Registration Screen**: A user-friendly screen that allows new users to create an account.
- **State Management**: The authentication state is managed by an `AuthNotifier` provider, which ensures that the UI is always up-to-date.

### Home Screen

After a user successfully logs in, they are directed to the home screen. This screen displays a welcome message and provides a way for the user to log out.

- **Welcome Message**: A personalized welcome message that includes the user's email address.
- **Logout Button**: A simple and intuitive way for the user to sign out of the application.

### Theme

The application includes a flexible and customizable theme, with support for both light and dark modes. The theme is managed by a `ThemeProvider`, which allows the user to switch between themes at any time.

- **Color Scheme**: The color scheme is based on Material Design 3 principles, with a seed color that can be easily customized.
- **Typography**: The typography is based on the `google_fonts` package, which provides a wide variety of fonts to choose from.

## Design

The application is designed to be visually appealing and easy to use. It follows modern design guidelines, with a clean and intuitive user interface.

### Layout

The layout is based on a card-based design, with a clear and consistent hierarchy of information. The use of whitespace and padding ensures that the UI is easy to read and navigate.

### Components

The application uses a variety of modern UI components, such as elevated buttons, text fields, and circular progress indicators. These components are styled to match the overall design of the application.
